### Algorithm for Creating User - Signup

```
IF existingUserByEmail EXISTS THEN
    IF existingUserByEmail.isVerified THEN
        success: false
    ELSE
        // Update and save the existing user's information
    END IF
ELSE
    // Create and save a new user with the provided details
END IF
```
