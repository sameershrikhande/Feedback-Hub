## Reference Notes : üìù

### Algorithm for Creating User - Signup

- Our algorithm ensures that users with an already verified email cannot register again, while allowing those who haven't verified their email to update their information. New users are created and saved with the provided details.

```
IF existingUserByEmail EXISTS THEN
    IF existingUserByEmail.isVerified THEN
        success: false
    ELSE
        // Update and save the existing user's information
    END IF
ELSE
    // Create and save a new user with the provided details
END IF
```
